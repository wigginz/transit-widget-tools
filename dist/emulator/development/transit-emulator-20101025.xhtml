    <h2>Transit Widget Emulator 1.2.2 build 20101025</h2>
    <h3>November 9, 2010</h3>

    <h3>Enhancements</h3>

    <ul>

      <li>WAC 1.0 API Support. The initial draft of WAC 1.0 API has been added to the emulator. To use it, create a new device profile or edit an existing one and choose the "WAC 1.0 API" on the "Manage Profiles..." dialog general panel. See wholesaleapplicationscommunity.com for detailed information about the WAC API. WAC Packaging is based on the JIL 1.2 packaging spec and is currently supported in the emulator.</li>

      <li>The non-debug pop-up window has been removed from the emulator as is wasn't terribly useful for development purposes, especially with smaller resolution screens. </li>

      <li>Import widget packages (.wgt files) is now possible with the new menu option in the Transit menus. To emulate a packaged widget, choose the "Emulate and Debug Widget (.wgt)" menu item and then choose the .wgt file in the file chooser dialog. The widget will be unzipped in your operatin system's temp folder and opened in the emulator window automatically. Temp directories are usually cleaned out on reboot, depending on your operating system.</li>

      <li> Some experimental and undocumented features have been prototyped and tested with this release. If an option is amrked as expiremental, we recommend not using it as it has not yet been documented.</li>

    </ul>
