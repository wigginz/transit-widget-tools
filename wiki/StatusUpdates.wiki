=== Fixes ===

Previously, static data was not being reset properly when a widget was reloaded or device profile changed. For example, the value for phoneScreenHeightDefault would be 800 but when a device profile for a smaller screen device, the API was still reporting a value of 800. This has been fixed anywhere in the API where there are accessible properties.

=== New Features ===

Added a link called "Callback Source" which will pop up a panel showing the source code of the event picked via the radio buttons for event contexts. 

Added a landscape mode toggle for the display section of the general tab in the emulator window. Checking the landscape mode box will swap height and width while maintaining full screen mode if checked. An onScreenChangeDimensions even will be triggered when landscape mode is toggled. Also changed is the behavior of the widget in floating mode. If a widget's height or width is larger than the screen size, the larger dimension will be shrunk to fix on the screen. For example, if a widget has a height of 500 pixels, but the device is only 400 pixels high, the widget will be resized to 400 pixels high.

Implemented widget config.xml ingestion based on JIL spec. Transit will now be able to detect and properly emulate widgets using either the JIL 1.0 or 1.2 packaging spec. This is leading us to full simultaneous JIL spec support for both packaging and API specs (coming soon). New ingestion process also includes per the spec validation and proper handling of all config.xml elements.

Quite a few changes have been made in this week's build including bug fixes, emulator interface improvements and some changes under the hood.

=== Fixes and UI Changes ===

Tackled the issue of smaller displays and cut off elements when emulating in the debug tab by adding scroll bars to the entire window if the device screen is taller than the viewable content. Also added a sliding panel separator allowing you to move the controls to the right to allow more space for the device screen. These changes work in both regular mode and debug mode.

Fixed an issue where audio and video APIs would not work when the emulator was opened as a tab in the main window (debug mode).

Fixed the problem with XMLHttpRequests not functioning from within a widget. This was due to the cross-domain security model Firefox uses with XMLHttpRequests. The fix involved wrapping the native XMLHttpRequest object in a JavaScript module. Currently, the wrapper only supports asynchronous requests. If implementing synchronous calls is needed in your widgets, please submit a request on the project home page and I'll get working on it. There are no security restrictions with the wrapper, it should work for all URIs.

=== Under the Hood ===

With this build, we're edging ever closer to phasing out the XPCOM components of the JIL APIs and moving towards more native JavaScript modules. Eventually all API implementations will be fully contained in modules allowing us to simultaneously support multiple versions of the JIL API. In an upcoming build we hope to allow a device profile to define which version of the JIL API it uses (1.0, 1.2, 1.3, etc.). We're keeping the runtime and profile service as wrapped XPCOM components to better mimic the logical separations an actual device would have. This is the first step in a major change that we'll be doing over the next couple of weekly releases, we will ensure regression tests are made before each build is posted.

This is an important bug fix release and it's highly recommended that you upgrade from the previous 20100709 build.

Changes include fixes in multimedia, messaging, telephony, and PIM JIL APIs. No significant functionality or interface changes have been made in this build.
