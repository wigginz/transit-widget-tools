== Tuesday June 28, 2010 ==

Some usability enhancements have been added as well as the beginnings of the security context implementation.

Quick list of what's new in the 20100628 build:

 * Changed emulator container background to the JIL logo to reduce the size of the image (previous was 1+ MB).
 * Tweaked the general settings tab to look more consistent with the others. Moved the error console button to the bottom and added security controls (not actually working yet though).
 * Added an optional delay time to triggering events to better simulate callbacks that may take a while to be executed (location, searches, etc.).
